Weather Dashboard
This weather dashboard is built using React.js and Tailwind CSS to fetch real-time weather data from two different APIs. Users can search for a city's weather, view a 7-day forecast, and toggle between Celsius and Fahrenheit. The dashboard includes a weather journal to track past searches, error handling for invalid inputs, and an option to export the journal as a PDF. It also features geolocation support to fetch weather based on the user's location and a favorites list to save and reorder preferred cities. 

E-Commerce Product Listing Page
This product listing page is built with React.js and Tailwind CSS, dynamically fetching product data while allowing users to filter, sort, and interact with items. It includes a product image carousel, a debounced search bar, category and price filtering, and a "Recommended for You" section based on user activity. Users can add items to a wishlist and browse through products using pagination or infinite scroll. Additional features include a shopping cart with quantity controls and total price calculation, along with smooth hover animations for better user experience.
